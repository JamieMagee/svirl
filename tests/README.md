# Tests for Ginzburg-Landau CUDA solver

* Automatic tests have prefixes `at_`. `run_at.sh` runs all automatic tests.
* Manual tests have prefixes `mt_`. Typically, these tests have some graphical output. In future, all manual test supposed to be converted to automatic tests.
* Outdated and irrelevant tests begin with prefixes `_`. Supposed to be removed in future.
